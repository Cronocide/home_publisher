# home_publisher
## An automation to update public infrastructure to represent my internal lab

`home-publisher` is a script that consumes a simple INI format described below (usually generated by consul-template) and creates Unifi port forwarding directives and Cloudflare DNS entries for the services described in the config file.
Used with consul and consul-template, it a a powerful way to deploy dynamic services out of a homelab that uses Unifi and Cloudflare as the delivery tech stack.

## Usage

```
usage: home_publisher [-h] [-C] [-U] [-d] [-l LOG] [-v] cnf_file

positional arguments:
  cnf_file           The path to the CNF file to process.

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -C, --cloudflare   Update Cloudflare.
  -U, --unifi        Update Unifi.
  -d, --dry-run      Describe the changes but don't make any changes.
  -l LOG, --log LOG  Specify a file to log to.
  -v, --verbose      Include debug information in the output. Add 'v's for more output.

	home_publisher -vv /path/to/file.ini
```
